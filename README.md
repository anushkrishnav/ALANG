# Creating a more English like language
Interpreted Implemented in Python 
## Alang stands for (Anush Language) Unless I find a better expansion 
<br/>
Hope the project is good  cause... well... it got my name for starter  XD.<br/>
I use python for the interpreter implementation since I am very comfortable with it.
I am not going to use a virtual environment since I have decided to build this interpreter by using the inbuilt modules and self created methods.


### This project is the result of inspiration from many sources.
I have referred lots of articles, blogs and books to Understand and develop this interpreter.
I will try to share the resources and give credit wherever possible.<br/>

#### There are 3 Folders 
[ActionPlan] (https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/ActionPlan) -> Diagrams, Concepts brief, Algorithms
[Journey](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/Journey)->I document and share my experiance on a day to day basis.The code will be explained . Every Day folder will contain the code built till that particular day. So that we can easily acess the improvement over time.


The Day-n.py file contains the code which you can pull and excecute it . It Support python 3.6+
For the latest version of the interpreter visit [SourceCode](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/SourceCode)
Pull the [Token.py](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/SourceCode/Token.py) 
[Lexer.py](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/SourceCode/Lexer.py) file and interpreter.alng file
compile and execute the interpreter file by passing the  command below.
$python3 interpreter.alng
